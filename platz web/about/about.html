	<h1>ABOUT</h1>
	<section>
	<p>Platz Stencil was designed through the use of Futura medium. The grid for the cuts depends where the strokes would meet.<br>
	 I was inspired by the typefaces of Bifur and _, which gave me the idea of adding a few lines to play with nagative space.<br>
	 Like bifur I wanted to have at least one line that stayed attached to the typeface. This is the case with the top outer line.<br>
	 The middle line is to show the eveness of the typrface itself. Just as Futura whose structure is measured evenly into "perfection".
