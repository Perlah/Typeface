	<p> I wanted to make a stencil using one of the modern typefaces avaliable and make it into something experimental. I chose Futura medium because of
	 its geometric roots. Since Stencils has some form of geometric shapes, I decided to use Futura as a base. I Know Paul Renner designed the typeface with
	 the idea of using perfect shapes like circles, triangles, and squares. I was inspired by the typefaces of Bifur and Grus Outline, which gave me the idea
	 of adding a few lines to play with the negative space that a stencil would have. Like bifur I wanted to have at least one line that stayed attached to the
	 typeface. The grid for the cuts depends on where the strokes would meet within the typeface. The middle line is to show the eveness of the typeface itself,
	 just as Futura whose structure is measured evenly into "perfection". These lines would look as an outline just like the idea from the Grus outline typeface.
	 You can see this with some of the letters I developed.

	  I developed this website to showcase my typeface the best as I possibly can. I wanted to play with the idea of 
	 image and type, so I have some examples with quotes from Paul Renner and Walter Gropius. Just as Futura being a modern typeface,
	 I would also develop this website as modern and simple as I possibly can. It showcases my typeface
	 through all the pages the way it is meant to be, as a display typeface.
